# BSM-model

## History of the Black-Scholes Model:

• Developed in 1973 by Fischer Black, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, the BlackScholes model was the first widely used mathematical method to calculate the  theoretical value of an option contract.

• Black-Scholes posits that instruments, such as stock shares or futures contracts will  have a lognormal distribution of prices following a random walk with constant drift and  volatility.

• The Black-Scholes equation requires five variables. These inputs are volatility, the  price of the underlying asset, the strike price the option, the time until expiration of  the option, and the risk-free interest rate.

## The Black-Scholes model makes certain assumptions:
• No dividends are paid out during the life of the option.

• Markets are random (i.e., market movements cannot be predicted).

• There are no transaction costs in buying the option.

• The risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying asset are known and constant.

• The returns on the underlying asset are log-normally distributed.

• The option is European and can only be exercised at expiration.
